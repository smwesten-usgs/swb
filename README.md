SWB - A Modified Thornthwaite-Mather Soil-Water-Balance Code for Estimating Groundwater Recharge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) computer code has been developed to calculate spatial and temporal
 variations in groundwater recharge. The SWB model calculates recharge by use of commonly available
 geographic information system (GIS) data layers in combination with tabular climatological data.
The code is based on a modified Thornthwaite-Mather soil-water-balance approach, with
components of the soil-water balance calculated at a daily timestep.
Recharge calculations are made on a rectangular grid of computational elements that may be
easily imported into a regional groundwater-flow model. Recharge estimates calculated by
 the code may be output as daily, monthly, or annual values.

> :warning: **Warning!**
SWB version 1.x receives infrequent bug fixes. Development of the SWB code continues under the name 'SWB2' in this repo: https://github.com/smwesten-usgs/swb2. Users should consider using SWB2 unless there is a compelling reason to prefer version 1.x.
