Name: GRAFMP  24
The routine GRAFMP plots a geographical axis system.
The call is:  CALL GRAFMP (XA, XE, XOR, XSTP, YA, YE, YOR, YSTP)
         or:  void grafmp (
                     float xa, float xe, float xor, float xstp, 
                     float ya, float ye, float yor, float ystp);
XA, XE        are the lower and upper limits of the X-axis.
XOR, XSTP     are the  first X-axis label  and the step  between
              labels.
YA, YE        are the lower and upper limits of the Y-axis.
YOR, YSTP     are the  first Y-axis label  and the step  between
              labels.
Notes:      - GRAFMP  must be  called  from level 1 and sets the
              level to 2.
            - The axes  must  be linear and scaled in  ascending
              order.  In general, X-axes must be scaled  between
              -180 and 180 degrees and Y-axes between -90 and 90
              degrees.
            - For  elliptical  projections,  the plotting  of an
              axis system will be suppressed.  This will also be
              done for azimuthal projections with YE - YA > 90.
            - The statement  CALL GRIDMP (I, J) overlays an axis
              system with a grid of longitude and latitude where
              I and J  are the number  of grid lines between la-
              bels in the X- and Y-direction.
Name: GRIDMP  24

Name: XAXMAP  24
The routine XAXMAP plots a secondary X-axis.
The call is:  CALL XAXMAP (A, B, OR, STEP, CSTR, NT, NY) level 2
         or:  void xaxmap (float a, float b, float or, 
                        float step, char *cstr, int nt, int ny);

CSTR          is a character string containing the axis name.
NT            indicates how ticks, labels  and the axis name are
              plotted.  If NT = 0, they are plotted  in a clock-
              wise direction.  If NT = 1,  they are plotted in a
              counter-clockwise direction.
NY            defines the horizontal  position  of the X-axis. A
              secondary  axis  must be located  inside  the axis
              system.
Name: YAXMAP  24

              secondary  axis  must be  located  inside the axis
              system.

                                        Default: CTYPE = 'CYLI'.
Notes:      - For cylindrical equidistant projections,  the sca-
              ling parameters in GRAFMP must be in the range:
                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                         -180 <= YA <= YE <= 180
              For Mercator procektions:
                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                         - 85 <= YA <= YE <=  85
              For cylindrical equal-area projections:
                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=  90
              For elliptical projections:
                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                            XE - XA <= 360
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=  90
              For conical projections:
                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                            0 <= YA <= YE <=  90  or
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=   0
              For azimuthal projections with  YE - YA > 90,  the
              hemisphere around the map pole is projected onto a
              circle. Therefore,  the hemisphere can be selected
              with the map pole. The plotting of the axis system
              will be  suppressed.
              If YE - YA <= 90, the part of the globe defined by
              the  axis scaling  is projected  onto a rectangle.
              The map pole will be set by GRAFMP to  ((XA+XE)/2,
              (YE+YA)/2).  The scaling parameters must be in the
              range:
                         -180 <= XA <= XE <= 180 and
                                 XE -  XA <= 180
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=  90
          -   For all projections except the default projection,
              longitude and latitude coordinates will be projec-
              ted  with the same scaling factor  for the X-  and
              Y-axis.  The scaling factor is  determined  by the
              scaling of the  Y-axis  while the  scaling  of the
              X-axis  is used  to centre the map.  The longitude
              (XA+XE)/2  always lies  in the centre  of the axis
              system.

Name: MAPIMG  24
The routine MAPIMG  plots a BMP  or  GIF raster image to an axis
system.  Some parameters  which describe the location, scale and
rotation of  the map  are passed to  MAPIMG. The parameters have
the  same  meaning  as  the attributes of the  ESRI  World  File 
Format.   
The call is:  CALL MAPIMG (CFIL, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6) level 2

X2            is the rotation about the Y-axis.
X3            is the rotation about the X-axis.
X4            is the  pixel size in the Y-direction in map units
              per pixel.  This  value  is  normally  a  negative 
              number.

              left pixel.

              left pixel.
Name: CURVMP  24
The routine  CURVMP  plots curves  through data points  or marks
them with symbols.
The call is:  CALL CURVMP (XRAY, YRAY, N)                level 2

Notes:      - CURVMP  is similar to  CURVE  except  that  only a
              linear interpolation can be used.
            - In general, a line between two points on the globe
              will not be projected as  a straight line.  There-
              fore,  CURVMP interpolates lines linearly by small
              steps.  An alternate plotting mode can be set with
              MAPMOD.

              mined by the scaling of the Y-axis while  the sca-
              ling  of the  X-axis  is used to centre  the  map.
              For  COPT = 'AUTO',  DISLIN  tries the  change the
              length of the X-axis, so that the axis length cor-
              responds to the scaling  parameters in  GRAFMP for
              the X-axis.
