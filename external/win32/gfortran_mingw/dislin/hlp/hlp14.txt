              function values. If XA, XE, YA and YE are the axis
              limits in  GRAF or values defined with the routine
              SURSZE, the connection of  grid points and  matrix

              ZMAT(I,J) = F(X,Y) where
                X = XA + (I - 1) * (XE - XA) / (N-1),  I=1,..,N

              be used to pass a matrix with  a better resolution
              to CONTUR and CONMAT.
            - Geographical projections  can be defined  for con-
              touring.
            - The thickness of contours can be set with  THKCRV.
              Line styles and colours can also be defined.
            - The number of matrix points in  CONTUR  and CONMAT
              is limited to N * M <= 256000 in Fortran 77. There
              is no limit for the C and Fortran 90  libraries of
              DISLIN.  
            - To plot contours  for randomly  distributed points
              of the form X(N), Y(N) and Z(N),  the routine GET-
              MAT can be used to calculate a function matrix, or
              the data can be triangulated with the routine TRI-

                           I3RAY, NTRI, ZLEV)         level 2, 3
         or:  void contri (float *xray, float *yray,

              I3RAY.

              to be calculated.
Name: CONSHD  25
The routine  CONSHD  plots filled  contours of the  function Z =
F(X,Y).  Two  algorithms  can be  selected  for contour filling:
a cell filling algorithm and a polygon filling algorithm.  For a
polygon filling,  only closed contours  can be filled. The algo-
rithm can be defined with the routine SHDMOD. 
The call is:  CALL CONSHD (XRAY, N, YRAY, M, ZMAT, ZLVRAY, NLEV) 
                                                      level 2, 3
         or:  void conshd (float *xray, int n, float *yray,
                           int m, float *zmat, float *zlvray,
                           int nlev);

              function values.

              be sorted  in ascending order  if cell filling  is
              selected.  For polygon filling,  the levels should
              be sorted  in such a way  that inner contours  are
              plotted last.
NLEV          is the number of levels.
Notes:     -  CONSHD may give better  results for a higher reso-
              lution of  ZMAT. A matrix with a higher resolution
              can be calculated with the  routine TRFMAT.
           -  The colours of the  filled contours are calculated
              from  a fictive colour bar  where  the minimum and
              maximum  of the contour  levels  are  used for the 
              lower  and  upper  limits of the  colour bar.  The 
              scaling of the colour bar can be modified with the
              routine ZSCALE while a colour bar can be displayed
              with the routine ZAXIS. If the colours of the fil-
              led  contours  should  not be  calculated  from  a
              colour bar, they can be defined directly  with the
              routine CONCLR.
           -  For  a cell filling,  the  calculation  of contour
              colours are described in the following. The levels
              are sorted  first in ascending order.  By default,
              the colour of the region between  two neighbouring
              levels  is  calculated from the lower value of the
              two levels.  If you want  to use the  upper value,
              you can define it with the routine SHDMOD('UPPER',
              'COLOUR').  In  default  mode    (SHDMOD ('LOWER', 
              'COLOUR'),  the cells  below  the minimum  of  the
              levels are filled with the lowermost colour of the
              colour bar,  the  cells  above  the maximum of the
              levels are filled with the uppermost colour of the
              colour bar.  The plotting  of this regions can  be
              suppressed with the statement CALL SHDMOD ('NONE',
              'CELL').

Name: CONMOD  25
The routine CONMOD modifies the appearance of contour labels. By
default,  DISLIN suppresses the plotting of labels at a position
where the contour is very curved.  To measure the curvature of a
contour for an interval, DISLIN calculates the ratio between the
arc length and the length of the straight line  between the  in-
terval limits. If the quotient is much greater than 1,  the con-
tour l ine is very curved in that interval.
The call is:  CALL CONMOD (XFAC, XQUOT)            level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void conmod (float xfac, float xquot);

              ture of contours  will be tested  in intervals  of
              the  length  (1 + XFAC) * W  where W  is the label
              length.
XQUOT         defines an  upper limit  for the  quotient  of arc
              length and length of the straight line  (> 1).  If
              the quotient is greater than  XQUOT,  the plotting
              of labels will be suppressed  in the tested inter-
              val.
                                            Default: (0.5, 1.5).

              height.
                                            Default: XFAC = 0.5.
Name: SHDMOD  25,23
The routine SHDMOD defines flat or smooth shading  for surfaces,  
or an algorithm  used for contour filling.
The call is:  CALL SHDMOD (COPT, CKEY)             level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void shdmod (char *copt, char *ckey);
CKEY          is a character  string  containing one of the fol-
              lowing keywords:
 = 'CONTUR'   defines  the algorithm  used for  contour filling.
              COPT  can  have  the  values 'CELL' and 'POLY'. 
              The default value is COPT = 'CELL'.
 = 'CELL'     modifies  the cell  filling  algorithm.  COPT  can
              have  the  values  'BOTH',  'UPPER',  'LOWER'  and 
              'NONE'.  If COPT =  'NONE',  the  filling  of  the
              regions  below  and  above  the  level limits  are
              suppressed. If COPT = 'UPPER',  the filling of the
              region  below the  lowermost  level is suppressed.  
              COPT = 'LOWER' means that the filling of the regi-
              on above the uppermost level is suppressed. By de-
              fault, both regions described above are filled. 
 = 'COLOR'    modifies  the calculation of colours for cell fil-
              ling. COPT can have the values  'LOWER',  'MIDDLE'
              and 'UPPER'.  For COPT = 'LOWER',  the lower value
              of  two  neighbouring  levels  is used  for colour 
              calculation, for  COPT = 'UPPER', the  upper value
              of two neighbouring levels is used, and for COPT =
              'MIDDLE', the mean value of the two levels is used
              for  colour  calculation.  The  default  value  is 
              COPT = 'LOWER'.
 = 'SURFACE'  defines flat or smooth shading for surfaces.  COPT
              can have the values  'FLAT' and 'SMOOTH'.  The de-
              fault value is COPT = 'FLAT'.
 = 'CULLING'  If  CKEY = 'CULLING',  COPT  can  have  the values 
              'ON', 'OFF' and 'FRONT'. COPT = 'ON' enables back-
              face  culling,   'COPT' = 'FRONT'  enables   front
              face culling  and  COPT = 'OFF' disables face cul-
              ling.  By default, backface culling is enabled. 
              This means that faces with a clockwise orientation
              of vertices will not be plotted. 
 = 'SYMBOLS'  This  option defines  2-D or  3-D symbols  for the 
              routine CURV3D.  COPT can have the values '2D' and
              '3D'. The default value is COPT = '2D'.
 = 'CURVE'    This option defines  2-D  or  3-D  curves  for the 
              routine CURV3D.  COPT can have the values '2D' and
              '3D'. The default value is COPT = '2D'.
 = 'ZSCALE'   This option enables or disables the calculating of
              colour values  from the  Z-coordinates in the rou-
              tines SURSHD, SURFCP and SURTRI. COPT can have the
              values 'ON' and 'OFF'.
