Name: WGDRAW  29
The routine  WGDRAW  creates a draw widget that can be used for

          put of  DISLIN routines to the draw widget. 
          For X11,  SETXID  should be called if the widgets are
          already realized.  Normally,  SETXID should be called
          in a callback routine.

        - Draw widgets can have scroll bars if SWGTYP is called
          before with the options ('SCROLL', 'DRAW').  For that
          case,  the size  of the  graphics can be defined with

             setting float, integer and character values.  CELL
             values can be requested  with the routines GWGTBL,
             GWGTBF, GWGTBI and GWGTBS.
           - Table cells  can be  editable  if this mode is en-
             abled with the routines SWGOPT or SWGTBS.  The set
             of possible  input characters  for editable  table
             cells may be restricted with the  'VERIFY'  option
             in SWGOPT and SWGTBS.
           - The width  of table columns  can be modified  with
             the routine SWGRAY.

              characters or a  negative  number between  -1 and
              -100.  If NWTH < 0,  the widget  width  is set to
              ABS(NWTH) * NWIDTH / 100    where  NWIDTH  is the 
              screen width.                 Default: NWTH = 20.

COPT          is a  character string  that can  have the values
              'BACK',  'FORE',  'SCROLL',  'LTEXT'  and 'PBAR'. 
              The keywords 'BACK' and  'FORE'  define back- and
              foreground colours,  'SCROLL'  and 'PBAR'  define
              the colour  of  the slider in  scale  widgets and
              progress bars,  and  'LTEXT' sets the  background
              colour  of the  edit window  in labeled text wid-
              gets.
Notes:      - Colours  can  not be defined for push button wid-
              gets.  This is a restriction in the Windows API.
            - Multiple  draw widgets  must have the  same back-
              ground colour since they  belong to the same wid-
              get class.  The same  is valid for multiple  main
              widgets created by WGINI. 
Name: SWGFOC  29
The routine  SWGFOC sets the keyboard focus to the specified
widget.

         or:  void swgopt (char *copt, char *ckey);
COPT          is a character string containing an option. 
CKEY          is a character string containing a keyword:
 = 'BORDER'   This  keyword defines borders around table cells.
              COPT  can  have  the  values   'NONE', 'COLUMNS',
              'ROWS' and 'BOTH'. The default value is 'BOTH'.
 = 'CALLBACK' The  behaviour  of  callback  routines  for  text
              widgets  can be modified with this keyword.  COPT
              can  have  the  values   'RETURN',  'CHANGE'  and 
              'BOTH'. For 'RETURN', the callback routine is on-
              ly called if a return is given in the text field,
              for 'CHANGE, the  callback routine  is called for
              each change in the text field.  The default value
              is 'RETURN'.
 = 'CLOSE'    This  keyword  changes the behaviour of the close
              button of the main widget. For COPT = 'QUIT', the
              program will be terminated.  For COPT = 'OK', the
              main  widget is deleted  and the program  is con-
              tinued after WGFIN.

              or not. COPT can have the values  'OFF' and 'ON'.
 = 'FRAME'    Enables or disables a frame around table widgets.
              COPT can have the values 'OFF' and 'ON'.
 = 'HEADER'   This  keyword enables header cells  in table wid-
              gets. COPT can have the values 'NONE', 'COLUMNS', 
              'ROWS' and 'BOTH'.
 = 'MASK'     If  CKEY = 'MASK',   COPT  can  have  the  values

              mask entry in the routines  WGFIL and  DWGFIL can
              be controlled  completely by the user.  For  that
              case,  the mask parameter in WGFIL and DWGFIL can
              have the following syntax:  it contains a pair of
              strings separated by a '+' sign. The first string
              contains the label, the  second string the search
              filter.  For example:
              'Data (*.dat)+*.dat'. 'Data (*.dat)' is the label
              while  '*.dat'  the  filter.  Multiple  pairs  of 
              strings for the mask are also possible.
 = 'PBAR'     This  option  changes  the appearance of progress
              bars.  COPT can  have the values  'SMOOTH',  'NO-
              SMOOTH', 'BACK',  'NOBACK',  'LABEL', ' NOLABEL',

              The  default  position  of the main widget is the 
              upper left corner of the screen.
 = 'SCROLL'   This  option  changes  the behaviour  of callback
              routines  for scroll widgets.  COPT can have  the 
              values  'TRACK',  'BUTTON'  and  'END'. If COPT =

              change  of the scroll value.  If COPT = 'BUTTON',
              the callback routine is  only called  if an  user
              releases the mouse button.  For COPT = 'END', the
              callback  routine  is  called  at  the end of the
              scroll action. 
 = 'VERIFY'   The keyword  'VERIFY'  enables a  check  of input
              characters in text and table cells. COPT can have
              the values  'NONE', 'INTEGER', 'FLOAT', 'EFLOAT',
              'DFLOAT',  'ALPHA',  'NALPHA',  'TIME',   'DATE',
              'EMAIL', 'PHONE', 'HEXA'  and 'OCTAL'. 
              The default value is COPT = 'NONE'. 
 = 'SEPARATOR'     This option selects a line style for  WGSEP.
              COPT can  have the values  'STANDARD',  'SINGLE',
              'DOUBLE', 'DASH' and 'DDASH'.
 = 'DIALOG'   Dialog  widgets  created  by the DWG routines de-
              scribed  in paragraph 15.5  can have  the topmost
              attribute,  so that  they are not  overplotted by
              other windows.  COPT can have the values  'STAND-
              ARD' and  'TOP'.  This option is only on  Windows
              systems available, not on X11 systems.
                                  Defaults: ('BOTH', 'BORDER'),
                                        ('RETURN', 'CALLBACK'),

                                               ('OFF', 'EDIT'),
                                               ('ON', 'FRAME'),
                                            ('NONE', 'HEADER'),
                                          ('STANDARD', 'MASK'),
                                      ('STANDARD', 'POSITION'),
                                          ('BUTTON', 'SCROLL'),
                                            ('NONE', 'VERIFY'),
                                     ('STANDARD', 'SEPARATOR'),
                                        ('STANDARD', 'DIALOG').

              in scrolled table widgets.
 = 'LIST'     means  that N defines  the number of visible en-
              tries in scrolled list widgets.

              such as System, FixedSys, Terminal, Courier,   MS
              Serif  and MS Sans Serif.  For X11, CFNT can con-
              tain an X11 font.  CNFT = 'STANDARD'  resets  the
              font to the default value.
NPTS          is the font size in points  (72 points = 1 inch).
              Note that  only  a few  different  font sizes are 
              available for Windows raster fonts.
              For X11, the parameter NPTS will be ignored since
              the font size is already part of the font name.

The callback routine is called  if the status  of the  widget is
changed.  Callback routines be defined for button,  push-button,
