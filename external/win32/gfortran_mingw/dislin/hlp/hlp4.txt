Name: GRAF    6
GRAF plots a two-dimensional axis system.                level 1
The call is:  CALL GRAF (XA, XE, XOR, XSTEP, YA, YE, YOR, YSTEP)
         or:  void graf (float xa, float xe, float xor, float x-
              step, float ya, float ye, float yor, float ystep); 
XA, XE        are the lower and upper limits of the X-axis.
XOR, XSTEP    are the first X-axis label  and  the step  between
              labels.
YA, YE        are the lower and upper limits of the Y-axis.
YOR, YSTEP    are the first  Y-axis label  and the step  between
              labels.
Notes:      - GRAF must be called in  level 1 and  automatically
              sets the level to 2.  When  plotting  more  than 1
              axis system  on a page,  ENDGRF must be  called in
              between  each new set of axes in order  to set the
              level back to 1.
            - The axis scaling is linear  by default  and can be
              changed with AXSSCL. For logarithmic scaling,  the
              corresponding parameters in GRAF must be exponents
              of base 10.
            - If the  numerical value  of the lower limit of  an
              axis is larger  than the upper limit and the label
              step is negative,  axis scaling will be in descen-
              ding order.
Name: GRAFP   6
The routine GRAFP plots a two-dimensional polar axis system.
The call is:  CALL GRAFP (XE, XOR, XSTEP, YOR, YSTEP)    level 1
         or:  void grafp (float xe, float xor, float xstep,
                          float yor, float ystep);
XE            is upper limit  of the X-axis (radius coordinate).
XOR, XSTEP    are the first  X-axis label  and the  step between
              labels.
YOR, YSTEP    are the first  Y-axis label  and the  step between
              labels specified in degrees.  The Y-axis is scaled
              from 0 to 360 degrees.
Notes:      - The direction and position of the angle labels can
              be modified with the routine POLMOD.
            - GRAFP  is a  new name  for the old routine  POLAR,
              since polar  is also a C99 function.  The old rou-
              tine POLAR is still in the DISLIN libraries.

The routine GAXPAR calculates parameters for GRAF from a minimum

              V1 > V2, the calculated parameters will be in  de-
              scending order.
COPT          is  a character  string  that can have  the values
              'NOEXTEND' and 'EXTEND'.  For COPT = 'EXTEND', the
              calculated axis limits are extended to a full axis
              step.  Otherwise,  V1  and  V2  are  used  as axis 
              limits.

              DIG for the labels.
Notes:      - The same algorithm as in  SETSCL for setting auto-
              matic axis scaling is applied to GAXPAR.  
            - The current axis settings such as linear or  loga-
              rithmic  scaling  are used by  GAXPAR.  For  loga-
              rithmic scaling, the parameters V1 and V2  must be
              exponents of base 10.
