              DISLIN windows  that are defined  with the routine
              OPNWIN.
Name: DISENV  1
A few routines in DISLIN such as some font and map routines need
the path to the  DISLIN  installation directory for reading font
and map files.  The  DISLIN installation directory can either be
defined outside  of a program with the environment variable DIS-
LIN,  or within a program  with the routine DISENV.  If none  of
the methods  above is applied, the default directories c:\dislin
and  /usr/local/dislin  are used on  Windows and Linux/UNIX sys-
tems.  If the DISLIN environment  is already defined  outside of
the program, a call to DISENV has no affect.
The call is:  CALL DISENV (CPATH)               level 0, 1, 2, 3
         or:  void disenv (char *cpath);

              the page length and height.
Name: CENTER  6
A call to the routine CENTER will centre the axis system  on the
page. All elements of an axis system, including the title,  axis
labels and names, will be taken into consideration.  The centra-
lisation is done by  GRAF  through changing  the position of the
origin.  Therefore, all plotting routines called after GRAF will
work with the new origin.

LIN if the routine SETSCL is used.  In this case, GRAF must have
dummy parameters in which DISLIN returns the calculated values.
The call is:  CALL SETSCL (XRAY, N, CAX)                 level 1
         or:  void setscl (float *xray, int n, char *cax);
XRAY          is a vector that contains user coordinates. SETSCL
              calculates  the minimum and  maximum values of the
              data and stores them in a common block.
 N            is the number of points in XRAY.
 CAX          is a character string that defines the axes.
 Notes:     - SETSCL  can be used  with linear  and  logarithmic
              scaling and with all label types.
            - The calculation  of scaling  and label  values  is
              done by GRAF. The minimum and maximum of the  data
              are always used for the lower and upper  limits of
              an axis  while even values  are calculated for the
              labels.
            - The number of digits  after the decimal point will
              be set automatically.
            - If the scaling of an axis  is logarithmic,  labels
              will be plotted with the format 'LOG'.

another value,  minor ticks are plotted  as specified in  TICKS.

              the  middle of the axis sytem  with  the radius NR
              where NR is the minimum of the axis lengths.
   = 'NONE'   suppresses clipping.

         or:  void grace (ngra);
NGRA          is the width of the margin in plot coordinates. If
              NGRA is negative, lines will be clipped inside the
              axis system.
                                              Default: NGRA = -1
Name: FRAME  6,11

              If  NFRM is negative,  the frame will be thickened
              from the inside.  If positive,  the frame  will be
              thickened towards the outside.

         or:  void axclrs (int nclr, char *copt, char *cax);
NCLR          is a colour value. If NCLR = -1, the actual colour
              is used.
COPT          is a  character string  that can have  the  values
              'LINE', 'TICKS', 'LABELS', 'NAME' and 'ALL'.
CAX           is a character string that defines the axes.
                                    Default: (-1, 'ALL', 'XYZ').
Name: TITLIN  9
This subroutine defines  up to four  lines of text used for axis
system titles.  The text can be plotted with  TITLE after a call
to GRAF.
The call is:  CALL TITLIN (CSTR, IZ)               level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void titlin (char *cstr, int iz);
CSTR          is a character string (<= 132 characters).
IZ            is an integer that contains a value between  1 and
              4 or -1 and -4.  If IZ is negative,  the line will
              be underscored.
                      Default: All lines are filled with blanks.
Name: LFTTIT  9
Title lines are centred above axis systems by default but can be
left-justified with a call to LFTTIT.
The call is:  CALL LFTTIT                          level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void lfttit ();
Name: TITPOS  9

         or:  void titjus (char *cjus);
CJUS          is a character string  that can  have  the  values
              'CENT', 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT'.

         or:  void linesp (float xfac);
XFAC          The space  between  lines is set  to:  XFAC * cha-
              racter height.                Default:  XFAC = 1.5
Name: HTITLE  9
HTITLE  defines the  character  height for titles. The character
height defined by HEIGHT will be used if HTITLE is not called.
The call is:  CALL HTITLE (NHCHAR)                 level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void htitle (int nhchar);
NHCHAR        is the character height in plot coordinates.
Name: VKYTIT  9
The space between  titles  and axis systems  can be enlarged  or
reduced  with  VKYTIT.  By default,  the space is  2 * character
height.
The call is:  CALL VKYTIT (NV)                     level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void vkytit (int nv);
NV            is an integer that determines  the spacing between
              axis systems  and titles.  If NV is negative,  the
              space will be reduced by  NV plot coordinates.  If
              NV is positive,  the space will be  enlarged by NV
              plot coordinates.
                                                 Default: NV = 0
