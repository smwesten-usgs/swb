Name: COLOR  4
COLOR defines the colours used for plotting text and lines.
The call is:  CALL COLOR (CNAME)                   level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void colour (char *cname);
CNAME         is a  character  string  that can  have the values
              'BLACK', 'RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE', 'CYAN', 'YELLOW',
              'ORANGE',  'MAGENTA',  'WHITE', 'FORE' and 'BACK'.
              The  keyword  'FORE'  resets  the  colour  to  the 
              default value,  while the  keyword 'BACK' sets the
              colour  to the background colour.
Note:         The values 'BLACK' and 'WHITE' define not absolute
              colours. If the output format is  in reverse mode,
              'BLACK' is interpreted as  'WHITE'  and 'WHITE' is
              interpreted as 'BLACK'.  If  you want  to use true
              black and true white, you can use the routine SET-
              RGB (0., 0., 0.) and SETRGB (1., .1., 1.).

Notes:      - The file format  must be set to 'PS', 'EPS', 'PDF'
              or 'SVG'  with the routine  METAFL. For SVG files,
              the Times,  Helvetica  and  Courier  fonts  can be
              used. 
            - Font names cannot be shortened. Some printers pro-
              vide additional  non-standard fonts.  These  fonts
              should  be specified  exactly in  upper  and lower
              characters  as they are described  in the  printer
              manuals.  PostScript  suppresses  any graphics  if

              Arial Bold Italic

Note:         The coding of a Windows font should  correspond to
              the character coding defined with CHACOD. 
              For example,  if the character coding in CHACOD is
              set  to   'STANDARD'  or  'ISO1',  an  ISO-Latin-1
              should be used.  If the character coding is set to
              'UTF8', an Unicode font should be loaded.  
Name: X11FNT  4
X11FNT  defines an X11 font  for screen output on  X11 displays. 
The call is:  CALL X11FNT (CFONT, COPT)            level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void x11fnt (char *cfont, char *copt);
CFONT         is a character  string  containing  the first part
              of an X11 font.
COPT          is a character string containing the last part  of
              an  X11 font. IF COPT = 'STANDARD', the value 
              '-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1' is used for the last  part of
              an X11 font.
Notes:      - CFONT  must  begin  and end with the separator '-'
              and must  contain  the first five fields of an X11
              font. DISLIN adds then the point size and a trans-
              formation matrix to the font.  IF COPT has not the
              value 'STANDARD', it must begin with the character
              '-'  and contain the last 6 fields of an X11 font.
            - Here are  some  examples for the  contents  of 
              CFONT:  -Adobe-Times-Medium-R-Normal-
                      -Adobe-Times-Bold-R-Normal-
                      -Adobe-Times-Bold-I-Normal-
                      -Adobe-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-
                      -Adobe-Courier-Medium-R-Normal-
            - The coding of the  X11  font should  correspond to 
              the coding defined with CHACOD (see WINFNT).

              'COMPLX', 'SIMPLX' and 'HELVE'.
Note:         DISLIN  bitmap  fonts  are  added  to increase the 
              quality of directly created raster formats such as
              PNG and TIFF where  X11 and  TrueType fonts cannot  
              be used.
Name: HWFONT  4
The routine  HWFONT  sets a standard hardware  font  if hardware
fonts are supported by the current file format.  For example, if
the file format is PostScript,  the font  'Times Roman' is used,
if the file format is  'CONS'  or  'XWIN',  'Times New Roman' is 
used for Windows and '-*-Times-Bold-R-Normal-'  is used for X11.
If no hardware fonts are supported, COMPLX is used.
The call is:  CALL HWFONT                          level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void hwfont ();

              means the DISLIN coding of characters as displayed
              in the figures  6.4 to  6.10 of the DISLIN manual. 
              'ISO5'  and  'KOI8'  are  encodings  for  Cyrillic
              characters  while  'ISO7'  is  a coding  for Greek
              characters. 'UTF8' is a coding for Unicode charac-
              ters. If COPT  is not  'STANDARD',  the  coding is
              mapped to the available DISLIN characters.  
                                            Default: 'STANDARD'.

              addition  to the  names in  BASALF, CALPH can have
              the value 'INSTRUCTION'.
 C1           is a character that shifts to the alternate alpha-
              bet.
 C2           is a character that shifts back to the base alpha-
              bet.  C1 and C2  may be identical.  After the last
              plotted character  of a character  string,  DISLIN
              automatically shifts back to the base alphabet.
 N            is an integer between 1 and 6.  Up to 6  alternate
              alphabets can be defined.

              'NONE',  'GREEK',  'ITALIC',  'BOTH', 'SINGLE' and 
              'MULTI'. The options 'GREEK', 'ITALIC' and  'BOTH'
              enable Greek and Italic PostScript characters.  If
              they are disabled,  DISLIN  vector  characters are
              used. PSMODE must be called in level 1, 2 or 3 for
              this options.
              The option  'SINGLE'  defines  an old-style  Post-
              Script  format  without  PostScript  commands  for
              multiple pages.  PSMODE must be  called in level 0

              'GERMAN',  the characters  A, O, U, a, o, u  and s
              placed directly after C will be plotted as Ae, Oe,
              Ue, ae, oe, ue and ss.  With CNAT = 'DANISH',  the
              characters A, O, E, a, o  and e will be plotted as
              A-ring, O-slash, AE, a-ring, o-slash and ae.
Notes:      - Shift characters can be defined multiple where the
              characters must be different.
           -  The Turkish  characters are only supported by COM-
              PLX and  by the bitmap  fonts defined with BITMAP.
              The other  European characters are also  supported
              by PostScript.
           -  If the shift  characters  should  be  plotted in a
              text string, they must be doubled.
           -  European  characters  are  not  available  for the
              character codings 'ISO5', 'ISO7' and 'KOI8'.

        [     is used for exponents. The character height is re-
              duced by the scaling factor  FEXP  and the  pen is
              moved up  FBAS * NH  plot coordinates  where NH is
              the current character height.
        ]     is used for indices. The pen is moved down  FBAS *
