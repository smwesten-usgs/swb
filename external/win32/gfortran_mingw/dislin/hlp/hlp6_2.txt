Name: SHDPAT  12

Name: MYPAT   12
MYPAT defines a global shading pattern.
The call is:  CALL MYPAT (IANG, ITYPE, IDENS, ICROSS)
                                                   level 1, 2, 3

                                                    int icross);
IANG          is the angle of shading lines (0 - 179).
ITYPE         defines the type of shading lines:
         = 0  no shading lines.
         = 1  equidistant lines.
         = 2  double shading lines.
         = 3  triple shading lines.
         = 4  thick shading lines.
         = 5  dotted lines.
         = 6  dashed lines.
         = 7  dashed-dotted lines.
 IDENS        defines  the  distance  between  shading lines
              (0: small distance, 9: big distance).
 ICROSS       indicates  whether  shading lines are  hatched
              (0: not hatched, 1: hatched).
 Examples:    The following calls to  MYPAT  show the predefined

Name: SHIELD  15
SHIELD selects shielded regions  which are  set automatically by
DISLIN.
The call is:  CALL SHIELD (CAREA, CMODE)           level 1, 2, 3
         or:  void shield (char *carea, char *cmode);
CAREA         is a character string defining the regions:
  = 'MESSAG'  is used for text and numbers plotted by MESSAG and
              NUMBER.
  = 'SYMBOL'  will shield symbols.
  = 'BARS'    will shield bars plotted by BARS.
  = 'PIE'     will shield pie segments plotted by PIEGRF.
  = 'LEGEND'  will protect legends. All legend attributes should
              be set before calling  CURVE  because the shielded
              region of a legend is defined by  CURVE.  If there
              is no legend position defined with  LEGPOS,  CURVE
              assumes  that the legend  lies in the  upper right
              corner of the axis system.
CMODE         is a character string defining a status:
  = 'ON'      means that the regions defined above will be writ-
              ten to the shielding buffer and are protected.
  = 'OFF'     means  that regions  will  not be  written  to the
              shielding buffer. Regions that are still stored in
              the buffer will be shielded.
  = 'DELETE'  removes regions from the shielding buffer.
  = 'RESET'   is a  combination of  'OFF' and  'DELETE'. Regions
              are removed from  and will  not be written  to the
              shielding  buffer.  To save  computing time,  this
              command should always be used when shielding is no
              longer needed.
  = 'NOVIS'   The shielding  of regions  held in  the  shielding
              buffer is disabled.  This is not valid for regions
              newly written to the buffer.
  = 'VIS'     Disabled  regions  will be protected.  This is the
              default  value for regions  newly  written  to the
              buffer.
Notes:      - A frame is  plotted around  regions defined by the
              user.  The  thickness  of frames  can be  set with
              FRAME. Regions defined automatically by DISLIN are
              not  enclosed  by a  frame but  frames  plotted by
              MESSAG after using FRMESS and shielded regions de-
              fined by MESSAG are identical.
            - Shielded regions can overlap each other.
            - The statement CALL RESET ('SHIELD')  resets shiel-
              ding. All regions defined by  DISLIN  and the user
              are removed from the shielding  buffer and  no new
              regions will be written to the buffer.
            - The number  of shielded regions  is limited to the
              size of the shielding buffer which is set  to 1000
              words. The number of words used by regions are:
              SHLREC = 6,  SHLRCT = 7,  SHLCIR = 5,  SHLELL = 7,
              SHLPIE = 7 and SHLPOL = 2*N+3.
            - Shielding of regions is computer intensive. There-
              fore, shielding should be used very carefully  and
              shielded regions should be deleted from the buffer
              when no longer needed.
            - Base transformations do not  affect  the  position
              of shielded regions.
            - SHLPOL can be used between the routines GRFINI and
              GRFFIN.  The shielded  region  will  be  projected
              into 3-D space. This is not valid for other shiel-
              ded regions.
