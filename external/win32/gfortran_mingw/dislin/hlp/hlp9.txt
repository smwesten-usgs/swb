         or:  void erase ();
Note:         If backing store  is enabled  in  DISLIN  with the
              routine X11MOD,  the routine ERASE clears just the
              pixmap  and  not  directly  the  graphics  window. 
              Clearing just the pixmap  has the advantage that a
              new plot  can be  created  on the pixmap while the
              graphics window  remains unchanged. The pixmap can
              then be copied to the  graphics  window  with  the
              routine SENDBF.  This  double frame buffer  effect
              avoids flickering.

              as ENDGRF.
