   installed on that PC. The Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and MAC OSX distributions
   of DISLIN are classified as PC distributions.

   You may install and use DISLIN on a single UNIX or VMS workstation. The
   number of DISLIN users on that workstation is unlimited. The DISLIN
   distributions for Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Tru64 and OpenVMS need
   a Workstation License.
