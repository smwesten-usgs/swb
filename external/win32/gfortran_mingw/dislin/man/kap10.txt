bar graphs and pie charts.

10.1 Bar Graphs

                            B A R S

BARS plots bar graphs.

The call is:  CALL BARS (XRAY, Y1RAY, Y2RAY, N)   level 2, 3

XRAY          is an array of  user coordinates  defining the
              position of the bars on the X-axis.
Y1RAY         is an array of user coordinates containing the
              start points of the bars on the Y-axis.
Y2RAY         is an array of user coordinates containing the
              end points of the bars on the Y-axis.
N             is the number of bars.

Notes:     -  Shading patterns of bars can be selected  with
              SHDPAT or MYPAT. Shading  numbers will be  in-
              cremented by 1 after every call to BARS.
           -  Legends can be plotted for bar graphs.

                           F B A R S

FBARS  plots  financial  bars for open, high,  low and close
prices.  The bars are displayed  as line bars or candlestick
bars.

The call is:  CALL FBARS (XRAY,  Y1RAY, Y2RAY, Y3RAY, Y4RAY, 
                          N)                      level 2, 3

Notes:     -  The type of the financial bars can be selected
              with the routine BARTYP.
           -  BARCLR sets colours for finacial bars.

The following routines modify the appearance of bar graphs.

                         B A R T Y P

The routine BARTYP defines vertical or horizontal bars.

The call is:  CALL BARTYP (CTYP)               level 1, 2, 3

CTYP          is a character string defining the bar type.
   = 'VERT'   means that vertical bars will be plotted.
   = 'HORI'   means that horizontal bars will be plotted. If
              this parameter is used, XRAY defines the posi-
              tion of the bars on the Y-axis while Y1RAY and
              Y2RAY define  the position  of the bars on the
              X-axis.
   = '3DVERT' defines vertical 3-D bars.
   = '3DHORI' defines horizontal 3-D bars.
   = 'CANDLE' defines candlestick bars for financial bars.
   = 'TICKS'  defines financial line bars with tick marks.
                          Defaults: CTYP = 'VERT', 'CANDLE'.

                         C H N B A R

CHNBAR modifies colours and shading patterns for single 
bars.
 
The call is:  CALL CHNBAR (CATT)               level 1, 2, 3

CATT          is a character string defining bar attributes.
 = 'NONE'     means that  all bars will  be plotted with the 
              current colour and shading pattern.
 = 'COLOR'    means that the colour is changed for each bar.
 = 'PATTERN'  means that the shading pattern is changed  for
              each bar.
 = 'BOTH'     means  that  the colour and shading pattern is
              changed for each bar.
                                     Default: CATT = 'NONE'.

Notes:      - The sequence of colours is:  WHITE/BLACK, RED,
              GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, ORANGE, CYAN, MAGENTA.
              The sequence of shading patterns is 0 - 17.
              Colour and  pattern cycles can be changed with
              CLRCYC and PATCYC.
            - If the routine BARCLR is used, the changing of
              colours will be ignored.

                         B A R W T H

BARWTH defines the width of the bars.

The call is:  CALL BARWTH (XWTH)               level 1, 2, 3

XWTH          is a real number  defining the width.  If XWTH
              is positive, the bar width is the absolute va-
              lue of   XWTH * (XRAY(1)-XRAY(2)).  If XWTH is
              negative, the absolute value of  XWTH is  used
              where XWTH must be specified in plot coordina-
              tes.
                                        Default: XWTH = 0.75

                         B A R M O D

BARMOD modifies the width of bars.

The call is:  CALL BARMOD (CMOD, COPT)         level 1, 2, 3

CMOD          is a character string that can have the values 
              'FIXED' and 'VARIABLE'.  If CMOD = 'VARIABLE',
              the width of bars plotted by  the routine BARS
              will  be variable.  In that case,  XWTH should 
              have a  positive  value in  BARWTH  since  the  
              width  of bars  is calculated in a similar way
              as described in BARWTH.

COPT          is a  character  string that must  contain the
              value 'WIDTH'.
                                Default: ('FIXED', 'WIDTH').

                         B A R P O S

The position  of the  bars is  determined  by the parameters
XRAY, Y1RAY  and Y2RAY.  The routine  BARPOS  can be used to
select predefined positions. The parameters  XRAY, Y1RAY and
Y2RAY will contain the calculated positions.

The call is:  CALL BARPOS (COPT)               level 1, 2, 3

COPT          is a character string that defines the positi-
              on of the bars.
  = 'NONE'    means that  the positions  are defined only by
              the parameters in BARS.
  = 'TICKS'   means  that the bars  will be centred at major
              ticks. XRAY must be a dummy vector.
  = 'AXIS'    means that  vertical bars start at the  X-axis
              and horizontal bars at the Y-axis.  Y1RAY must
              be a dummy vector.
  = 'BOTH'    activates the options 'TICKS' and 'AXIS'. XRAY
              and Y1RAY must be dummy arrays.
                                     Default: COPT = 'NONE'.

Bars can be  plotted on top of  one another  if the  routine
BARS is called several times.  To plot bars  side by side in
groups, the routine BARGRP can be used.

                         B A R G R P

The routine  BARGRP  puts bars with  the same  axis position
into groups. The number of group elements should be the same
as the number of calls to the routine BARS.

The call is:  CALL BARGRP (NGRP, GAP)          level 1, 2, 3

NGRP          is the number of bars defining one group.
GAP           defines the spacing between group bars. If GAP
              is positive, the value GAP * W is used where W
              is the width of a single bar.  If GAP is nega-
              tive, the positive value of GAP  is used where
              GAP must be specified in plot coordinates.

                         B A R C L R

The routine  BARCLR  defines  the colours of bars. Different 
colours can be defined for the sides of 3-D bars.

The call is:  CALL BARCLR (IC1, IC2, IC3)      level 1, 2, 3

IC1, IC2, IC3 are colour values for the front, side and  top
              planes  of 3-D bars.  The value -1  means that
              the corresponding  plane  is plotted  with the 
              current colour.
              For financial bars, IC1 is  the colour  of the
              line bars,  IC2 the  colour  of the open ticks 
              and IC3 the colour of the close ticks. 
                                      Default: (-1, -1, -1).

                         B A R B O R

The routine  BARBOR  defines the colour  of borders  plotted
around the bars.  By default, a border in the current colour
is plotted around 2-D bars,  and borders  in the  foreground
colour are plotted around 3-D bars.

The call is:  CALL BARBOR (IC)                 level 1, 2, 3
 
IC            is a colour value. If IC = -1, the bar borders
              will be plotted with the current colour.

                         B A R O P T

The routine BAROPT modifies the appearance of 3-D bars.

The call is:  CALL BAROPT (XF, ANG)            level 1, 2, 3

XF            is  a floating point  number  that defines the 
              depth of bars.  IF XF = -1.,  the bar width is
              used for the bar depth.  IF XF > 0., XF is in-
              terpreted as the  bar depth specified  in plot
              coordinates.

ANG           defines an  angle measured  in degrees between
              the front and side planes of 3-D bars.
                                        Default: (-1., 45.).

              for segment labels.  More than one line can be
              defined for labels.  CBUF must be created with
              LEGLIN after calling LEGINI.  If NLIN is 0  in
              the parameter list,  CBUF can be a dummy vari-
              able.

           -  Segment labels  can  contain several  lines of
              text and  the data values specified in PIEGRF.
              Data values  can also  be converted to percent
              values.
           -  Segment  labels  are  contained  within  a box

is plotted around 2-D pies,  and borders  in the  foreground
colour are plotted around 3-D pies.

The call is:  CALL PIEBOR (IC)                 level 1, 2, 3

IC            is a colour value.
                                            Default: IC = -1

The routine PIEOPT modifies the appearance of 3-D pies.

The call is:  CALL PIEOPT (XF, ANG)            level 1, 2, 3

XF            is a scaling number that defines the thickness
              of pies. The thickness is set to XF * radius.
ANG           defines an view angle measured in degrees.
                                        Default: (0.2, 45.).

The routine  PIELAB  defines character strings  that can  be
plotted on the left or right side of data values within seg-
ment labels.

The call is:  CALL PIELAB (CLAB, CPOS)         level 1, 2, 3

CLAB          is a character string displayed in segment la-
              bels.
CPOS          is a character string that defines the positi-
              on of CLAB.
  = 'LEFT'    means that  CLAB  will be plotted  on the left
              side of data values.
  = 'RIGHT'   means that  CLAB will be plotted  on the right
              side of data values.

Note:         If percent and data values are plotted in seg-
              ment labels,  PIELAB is only used for data va-
              lues.

Pie segments will be offset by 8% of the radius if PIEEXP is
called.

The call is:  CALL PIEEXP                      level 1, 2, 3

Note:         Single segments  will be offset if the corres-
              ponding values in PIEGRF are negative.

The routine PIEROT defines a rotation angle for 2-D pies.

The call is:  CALL PIEROT (ANGLE)              level 1, 2, 3

ANGLE         is the rotation angle in degrees.  The 2-D pie 
              is  rotated  in a counter-clockwise direction.

                         P I E V A L

The routine  PIEVAL  affects the distance of external labels
for the pie.

The call is:  CALL PIEVAL (X, CKEY)            level 1, 2, 3

X             is a  floating point variable  containing  the
              value.
CKEY          is a character string that can have the values
              'GAP' and 'DISTANCE'. The keyword 'GAP'  means
              the gap in plot coordinates between the arrows
              and the pie. The keyword 'DISTANCE'  defines a
              scaling factor for the  distance of  the label
              boxes from the pie.
                                      Default: (20., 'GAP'),
                                          (1.0, 'DISTANCE').

                         P I E V E C

PIEVEC modifies the arrows plotted between segments  and la-
bels that lie outside of segments.

The call is:  CALL PIEVEC (IVEC, COPT)         level 1, 2, 3

IVEC          defines the arrow head (see VECTOR).
COPT          is a character string  that defines the vector
              plotted between segments and labels.
 = 'NONE'     suppresses vectors.
 = 'STRAIGHT' means that straight vectors will be plotted.
 = 'BROKEN'   means that broken vectors will be plotted.
                                  Default: (2301, 'BROKEN').

The routine  PIECBK defines a user written callback  routine
that is called by PIEGRF for each segment. The callback rou-
tine allows the modification of pie charts  such as suppres-
sing certain labels.

The call is:  CALL PIECBK (Routine)            level 1, 2, 3

ROUTINE       is the name of a routine  defined by the user. 
              In Fortran,  the routine  must  be declared as 
              EXTERNAL. 

The syntax of the callback routine is:

SUBROUTINE    Routine (ISEG, XDAT, XPER,  NRAD, NOFF, ANGLE,
                       NVX, NVY, IDRW, IANN)      

where:

ISEG          is the segment index (starting with 1).
XDAT          is the data value  of the segment as specified
              in PIEGRF.
XPER          is the percent value of XDAT.
NRAD          is the segment radius in plot coordinates.
NOFF          is the segment offset in plot coordinates (de-
              fault: 0).
ANGLE         is the offset angle measured  in degrees  in a
              counter-clockwise direction. The default value
              is the angle which bisects the segment.
NVX           shifts the segment label in the X-direction by
              NVX plot coordinates.
NVY           shifts the segment label in the Y-direction by
              NVY plot coordinates.
IDRW          defines the plotting of segments. If IDRW = 0,
              plotting will be suppressed (default: 1).
IANN          defines the  plotting of labels.  If IANN = 0,
              labels will be suppressed (default: 1).

Notes:     -  The first 3 parameters in the callback routine
              are  only given for information  and cannot be
              changed by the user.
           -  The callback  routine is a replacement for the
              user written routine USRPIE that can still  be
              used,  but  is not  working for  shareable and
              DISLIN wrapper libraries.  USRPIE has the same
              syntax  as the callback routine,  but  without
              the parameter NVX.
