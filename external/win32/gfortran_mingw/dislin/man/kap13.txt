Chapter 13: Geographical Projections and Plotting Maps

This chapter presents different  methods  to project geogra-
phical coordinates  onto a plane surface.  Several base maps
are stored in DISLIN for plotting maps.

13.1 Axis Systems and Secondary Axes

                         G R A F M P

The routine GRAFMP plots a geographical axis system.

The call is:  CALL GRAFMP (XA, XE, XOR, XSTP,
                           YA, YE, YOR, YSTP)        level 2

XA, XE        are the lower and upper limits of the X-axis.
XOR, XSTP     are the  first  X-axis label  and the step be-
              tween labels.
YA, YE        are the lower and upper limits of the Y-axis.
YOR, YSTP     are the  first  Y-axis label  and the step be-
              tween labels.

Notes:     -  GRAFMP  must be called  from level 1  and sets
              the level to 2.
           -  The axes must be linear  and  scaled in ascen-
              ding order. In general,  X-axes must be scaled
              between  -180  and 180 degrees and  Y-axes be-
              tween -90 and 90 degrees.
           -  For elliptical projections, the plotting of an
              axis system will be suppressed. This will also
              be done for azimuthal projections with YE - YA
              > 90.
           -  The statement  CALL GRIDMP (I, J)  overlays an
              axis system with a longitude and latitude grid
              where I and J are the number of grid lines be-
              tween labels in the X- and Y-direction.

                         X A X M A P

The routine XAXMAP plots a secondary X-axis.

The call is:  CALL XAXMAP (A, B, OR, STEP, CSTR, NT, NY)
                                                     level 2

A, B          are the lower and upper limits of the X-axis.
OR, STEP      are the  first label  and the step between la-
              bels.
CSTR          is a  character  string  containing  the  axis
              name.
NT            indicates how ticks,  labels and the axis name
              are plotted. If NT = 0,  they are plotted in a
              clockwise direction. If NT = 1, they are plot-
              ted in a counter-clockwise direction.
NY            defines the horizontal position of the X-axis.
              A secondary axis  must be  located inside  the
              axis system.

                        Y A X M A P

The routine YAXMAP plots a secondary Y-axis.

The call is:  CALL YAXMAP (A, B, OR, STEP, CSTR, NT, NX)
                                                     level 2

A, B          are the lower and upper limits of the Y-axis.
OR, STEP      are the  first label  and the step between la-
              bels.
CSTR          is a  character  string  containing  the  axis
              name.
NT            indicates how ticks,  labels and the axis name
              are plotted. If NT = 0,  they are plotted in a
              clockwise direction. If NT = 1, they are plot-
              ted in a counter-clockwise direction.
NX            defines the  vertical  position of the Y-axis.
              A secondary axis  must be  located inside  the
              axis system.

13.2 Defining the Projection

Since a  globe cannot be unfolded into a plane surface, many
different  methods have been  developed to represent a globe
on a plane surface.  In cartography,  there are  4 basic me-
thods differentiated by attributes  such as  equal distance,
area and angle.

The 4 basic methods are:

a) Cylindrical Projections

   The surface  of the globe  is projected  onto  a cylinder
   which can be unfolded  into a  plane surface  and touches
   the globe at the equator. The latitudes and longitudes of
   the globe are projected as straight lines.

b) Conical Projections

   The surface  of the globe is projected  onto a cone which
   can  also be  unfolded  into  a plane  surface.  The cone
   touches or intersects the  globe  at two  latitudes.  The
   longitudes are projected  as straight lines  intersecting
   at the top of the cone and the latitudes are projected as
   concentric circles around the top of the cone.

c) Azimuthal Projections

   For azimuthal projections, a hemisphere is projected onto
   a plane which touches  the hemisphere  at a point  called
   the map pole.  The longitudes and latitudes are projected
   as circles.

d) Elliptical Projections

   Elliptical projections  project the entire surface of the
   globe onto an elliptical region.

                       P R O J C T

The routine PROJCT selects the geographical projection.

The call is:  CALL PROJCT (CTYPE)                    level 1

CTYPE         is a character string defining the projection.
  = 'CYLI'    defines a cylindrical equidistant projection.
  = 'MERC'    selects the Mercator projection.
  = 'EQUA'    defines a cylindrical equal-area projection.
  = 'HAMM'    defines the elliptical projection of Hammer.
  = 'AITO'    defines the elliptical projection of Aitoff.
  = 'WINK'    defines the elliptical projection of Winkel.
  = 'SANS'    defines the elliptical Mercator-Sanson projec-
              tion.
  = 'CONI'    defines a conical equidistant projection.
  = 'ALBE'    defines a conical equal-area projection
              (Albers).
  = 'CONF'    defines a conical conformal projection.
  = 'AZIM'    defines an azimuthal equidistant projection.
  = 'LAMB'    defines an azimuthal equal-area projection.
  = 'STER'    defines an azimuthal stereographic projection.
  = 'ORTH'    defines an azimuthal orthographic projection.
  = 'MYPR'    defines a user-defined projection.
                                    Default: CTYPE = 'CYLI'.

Notes:     -  For cylindrical equidistant  projections,  the
              scaling  parameters in  GRAFMP  must be in the
              range:

                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                         -180 <= YA <= YE <= 180

              For Mercator projections:

                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                         - 85 <= YA <= YE <=  85

              For cylindrical equal-area projections:

                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=  90

              For elliptical projections:

                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                             XE - XA <= 360
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=  90

              For conical projections:

                         -540 <= XA <= XE <= 540
                            0 <= YA <= YE <=  90  or
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=   0

              For azimuthal projections  with  YE - YA > 90,
              the  hemisphere  around  the map pole  is pro-
              jected  onto  a  circle. Therefore,  the hemi-
              sphere  can be selected with the map pole. The
              plotting of the axis system is by default sup-
              pressed. 
              If  YE  -  YA  <=  90,  the part  of the globe
              defined by the axis scaling  is projected onto
              a rectangle. The map pole will be set by GRAF-
              MP to ((XA+XE)/2, (YE+YA)/2).  The scaling pa-
              rameters must be in the range:

                         -180 <= XA <= XE <= 180 and
                                  XE - XA <= 180
                         - 90 <= YA <= YE <=  90
           -  For all projections except the default projec-
              tion, longitude and latitude coordinates  will
              be projected with the same scaling factor  for
              the  X- and  Y-axis. The scaling factor is de-
              termined  by the  scaling  of the Y-axis while
              the scaling of the  X-axis  is used  to centre
              the map.  The longitude  (XA+XE)/2 always lies
              in the centre of the axis system.
           -  Geographical projections  can only be used for
              routines described in this chapter or routines
              that plot contours.

The routine  MAPIMG  plots a BMP  or  GIF raster image to an
axis system.  Some parameters  which describe  the location,
scale and  rotation of  the map  are passed to  MAPIMG.  The 
parameters have  the  same meaning  as the attributes of the
ESRI World File Format.   

The call is:  CALL MAPIMG (CFIL, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6) 
                                                     level 2

              of a BMP or GIF file.
X1            is the  pixel size  in the  X-direction in map 
              units per pixel.
X2            is the rotation about the Y-axis.
X3            is the rotation about the X-axis.
X4            is the  pixel size  in the  Y-direction in map 
              units per pixel. This value is normally a neg-
              ative number.
X5            is the X-coordinate of the centre of the upper
              left pixel.

              left pixel.

13.4 Plotting Data Points

                         C U R V M P

The routine CURVMP plots curves through data points or marks
them with symbols.

The call is:  CALL CURVMP (XRAY, YRAY, N)            level 2

XRAY, YRAY    are real arrays containing the data points.
N             is the number of data points.

Notes:     -  CURVMP is similar to  CURVE except that only a
              linear interpolation can be used.
           -  In general,  a line between two points  on the
              globe  will  not  be  projected  as a straight
              line. Therefore, CURVMP interpolates lines li-
              nearly by small steps.  An alternate  plotting
              mode can be set with MAPMOD.

13.5 Parameter Setting Routines

                         M A P B A S

The routine  MAPBAS  defines  the map data file  used in the
routine WORLD.  An internal  DISLIN  map file, some external
map files compiled by  Paul Wessel  and map files in  Mapgen
format can be used.  The map files  compiled by  Paul Wessel
can be copied from the servers

   http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/data/gshhs
   ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhs/

The external map files 'gshhs_l.b', 'gshhs_i.b', 'gshhs_h.b'
and  'gshhs_f.b'  must be copied  to the map subdirectory of 
the DISLIN directory.

Map files in  Mapgen format are available from the Coastline
Extractor:

   http://rimmer.ngdc.noaa.gov/

COPT          is a character string that can have the values
              'BOTH', 'LAND',  'LAKE' and 'RIVERS'. The key-
              word 'BOTH' means 'LAND' and 'LAKE'. If COPT =
              'RIVERS',  the WDB rivers distributed with the
              GSHHS coordinates are plotted.
                                    Default:  COPT = 'BOTH'.

                         M A P P O L

MAPPOL defines the map pole used for azimuthal projections.

The call is:  CALL MAPPOL (XPOL, YPOL)               level 1

                                           Default: (0., 0.)

Note:         For an azimuthal  projection  with  YE - YA <=
              90,  the  map pole  will be  set by  GRAFMP to
              ((XA+XE)/2, (YA+YE)/2).

                         M A P S P H

For an azimuthal projection with YE - YA > 90,  DISLIN auto-
matically projects a hemisphere  around the map pole  onto a
circle. The hemisphere can be reduced using MAPSPH.

The call is:  CALL MAPSPH (XRAD)                     level 1

XRAD          defines the  region  around  the map pole that
              will be projected onto a circle   (0 < XRAD <=
              90).
                                         Default: XRAD = 90.

                         M A P R E F

titudes where the cone intersects or touches the globe.

The call is:  CALL MAPREF (YLW, YUP)                 level 1

YLW, YUP      are the lower and upper latitudes where:

                      0 <= YLW <= YUP <= 90  or
                   - 90 <= YLW <= YUP <=  0
                       Default:  YLW = YA + 0.25 * (YE - YA)
                                 YUP = YA + 0.75 * (YE - YA)

Note:         YLW and  YUP can have identical values and lie
              outside of the axis scaling.

                         M A P L A B

The routine  MAPLAB enables axis system labels for azimuthal
and elliptical projections.

The routine MAPMOD determines how data  points will be  con-
nected by CURVMP.

The call is:  CALL MAPMOD (CMODE)                 level 1, 2

CMODE         is a character string defining  the connection
              mode.
 = 'STRAIGHT' defines straight lines.
 = 'INTER'    means  that lines will be interpolated linear-
              ly.
 = 'GREAT'    means Great Circle interpolation.
                                  Default:  CMODE = 'INTER'.

                         M A P O P T

The routine  MAPOPT enables political borders plotted by the
routine WORLD, or sets an option to adjust the length of the
X-axis to the scaling.

The call is:  CALL MAPOPT (COPT, CKEY)            level 1, 2

COPT          is a character string containing an option.
CKEY          is a character string containing a keyword:
 = 'WORLD'    If  CKEY = 'WORLD',  COPT  can have the values 
              'COAST',  'BORDERS'  and  'BOTH'.  The default
              value is COPT = 'COAST'.
 = 'XAXIS'    If  CKEY = 'XAXIS',  COPT  can have the values
              'STANDARD' and 'AUTO'. Normally, longitude and 
              latitude  coordinates  will be  projected with
              the same scaling factor where the scaling fac-
              tor is determined by the scaling of the Y-axis
              while  the scaling  of the  X-axis  is used to 
              centre  the  map.  For  COPT = 'AUTO',  DISLIN 
              tries the change the length of the X-axis,  so
              that  the axis length  corresponds to the sca-
              ling parameters in  GRAFMP for the X-axis.  The 
              default value is COPT = 'STANDARD'.

                         P O S 2 P T

The routine  POS2PT converts map coordinates to plot coordi-
nates.

The call is:  CALL POS2PT (XLONG, YLAT, XP, YP)      level 2

XLONG, YLAT   are the map coordinates in degrees.
XP, YP        are the plot coordinates calculated by POS2PT.

The corresponding functions are:

              XP = X2DPOS (XLONG, YLAT)
              YP = Y2DPOS (XLONG, YLAT)

13.7 User-defined Projections

A user-defined  projection  can be enabled  with the keyword
'MYPR' in the routine PROJCT. For a user-defined projection,
the user must write a routine that  converts  longitude  and
latitude coordinates  to axis coordinates  (plot coordinates
relative to the origin of the axis system).  The name of the
user written routine  must  then passed  to  DISLIN with the 
routine SETCBK.

                         S E T C B K

The routine SETCBK defines a user written callback routine.

The call is:  CALL SETCBK (ROUTINE, 'MYPR') level 0, 1, 2, 3

ROUTINE       is the name of a routine defined by the user. 
              In Fortran, the routine must be declared as 
              EXTERNAL.

In the following example, a cylindrical projection is imple-
mented as a user-defined projection:

      PROGRAM MYPR
      EXTERNAL MYFUNC
      COMMON /MYCOMM/ XA,XE,YA,YE,NXL,NYL

      XA = -180.

      CALL GRIDMP (1,1)
      CALL WORLD 
      CALL DISFIN 
      END

      SUBROUTINE MYFUNC (XP, YP)  
      COMMON /MYCOMM/ XA,XE,YA,YE,NXL,NYL
      XP = (XP - XA)/(XE - XA) * (NXL - 1)
      YP = (YP - YA)/(YE - YA) * (NYL - 1)
