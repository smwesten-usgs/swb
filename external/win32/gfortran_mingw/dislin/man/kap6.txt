           Chapter 6: Parameter Setting Routines

All parameters in  DISLIN  have default  values  set by  the
initialization routine DISINI.  This chapter summarizes sub-
routines  that allow the user  to alter default values.  The
following routines can be called from level 1, 2 or 3 except
for those noted throughout the chapter. Subroutines that can
only be called  from level 0  must appear before DISINI.  In
general, parameter setting routines should be called between
DISINI and the plotting routines they affect.

6.1 Basic Routines

6.1.1 Resetting Parameters

                         R E S E T

RESET sets parameters back to their default values.

The call is:  CALL RESET (CNAME)               level 1, 2, 3

CNAME         is a character string  containing the name  of
              the routine whose parameters will be set  back
              to default values. If CNAME = 'ALL', all para-
              meters in DISLIN will be reset.

6.1.2 Changing the Plot Units

                         U N I T S

The routine UNITS defines the plot units.

The call is:  CALL UNITS (COPT)                      level 0

COPT          is a character string that can have the values
              'CM', 'INCH', 'POINTS' and 'TWIPS'. 'CM' means
              100 points per  centimetre,  'INCH'  means 100
              points per inch, 'POINTS' means 720 points per
              inch and 'TWIPS' means 1440 points per inch.  
                                       Default: COPT = 'CM'.

6.1.3 Modifying the Origin

                         P A G O R G

The routine  PAGORG sets the origin of the page. By default,
the page origin is located in the upper left  corner  of the
page.

The call is:  CALL PAGORG (COPT)               level 1, 2, 3 

COPT          is a character string that can have the values
              'TOP' and 'BOTTOM'. The keyword 'TOP' sets the
              page origin to the upper left corner, 'BOTTOM'
              to the lower left corner.
                                      Default: COPT = 'TOP'.

                         O R I G I N

In DISLIN,  all lines are plotted relative to a point on the
page which  is by default  identical  with  the page origin. 
Modifying this point by  ORIGIN  produces a shifting of plot
vectors on the page.

The call is:  CALL ORIGIN (NX0, NY0)                 level 1

NX0, NY0      are the coordinates of the origin.
                                            Default: (0, 0).


6.1.4 File Format Control

                         M E T A F L

METAFL defines the metafile format.

The call is:  CALL METAFL (CFMT)                     level 0

CFMT          is a  character string  that defines  the file
              format.
  = 'GKSL'    defines a GKSLIN metafile.
  = 'CGM'     defines a CGM metafile.
  = 'PS'      defines a coloured PostScript file.
  = 'EPS'     defines an Encapsulated PostScript file. The 
              format is nearly the same as for 'PS'.
  = 'PDF'     defines a PDF file.
  = 'HPGL'    defines an HPGL file.
  = 'SVG'     defines a Scalable Vector Graphics file.

  = 'VIRT'    defines a virtual file.  The metafile  is hold
              in a raster format in computer memory.
  = 'CONS'    defines a  graphics output  on the screen.  If 
              the screen  is a windows display,  a graphical 
              window is used that has nearly the size of the
              screen.
  = 'XWIN'    defines an X Window display.  By default,  the
              size of the window is nearly  2/3 of  the size
              of the screen.
  = 'GL'      defines an OpenGL window. By default, the size
              of the window is nearly 2/3 of the size of the
              screen.
                                     Default: CFMT = 'GKSL'.

Notes:      - The default size of GIF, TIFF, PNG, PPM,  BMP,
              IMAGE,  SVG  and virtual files is set to 853 x
              603 points  but can be modified  with the rou-
              tine WINSIZ. The size of graphical windows can
              also be defined with WINSIZ.
            - The default  background  colour  for graphical
              windows  and image formats such as  TIFF,  GIF
              and PNG is black but can  be changed  to white
              with the routine SCRMOD.
            - The format of  VIRT, TIFF,  PNG, BMP and IMAGE
              is by default a 8 bit palette format,  but can
              be changed  to a true colour  format  with the 
              parameter  'RGB'  in the  routine IMGFMT.  GIF 
              files created by  DISLIN  have  always a 8 bit
              palette format.
 
                         S E T F I L

By default, the plot file name consists of the keyword 'DIS-
LIN' and an extension  that depends  on the file format.  An
alternate filename can be set with SETFIL.

The call is:  CALL SETFIL (CFIL)                     level 0

CMOD          is a character string containing the mode.
  = 'COUNT'   means that a new file version will be created.
              An increasing version number  is added  to the 
              filename  and  the  filename  is shortened  to
              eight characters.
  = 'VERSION' is a similar option to  'COUNT' that creates a
              new  file  version,  but without  shorten  the
              filename.
  = 'DELETE'  means that the existing file will be overwrit-
              ten.
  = 'BREAK'   means that  the program  will be terminated by
              DISINI.
                                    Default: CMOD = 'COUNT'.

              between filenames and version numbers. If CKEY 
              = 'SEPARATOR',  COPT  can have the values 'UN-
              DERSCORE',  'HYPHEN'  and  'NONE'.  If  CKEY = 
              'NUMBER', COPT can have the values 'SHORT' and
              'LONG'.  The option  'LONG' means that leading
              zeros are used in the version number. The key-
              word  'DIGITS'  sets the number of digits that
              are  used  for version numbers.  For that key-
              word, COPT can have the values  '2', '3', '4',
              '5' and '6'. 
                              Defaults:  ('SEPARATOR', '_'),

SCLFAC sets the scaling factor for an entire plot.

The call is:  CALL SCLFAC (XFAC)                     level 0

XFAC          is the scaling factor by which the entire plot
              is scaled up or down.
                                          Default: XFAC = 1.

The method  by which  graphics  are scaled  to the  hardware
pages of devices such as a graphics terminal can be selected
with the routine SCLMOD.

The call is:  CALL SCLMOD (CMOD)                     level 0

CMOD = 'DOWN' means that graphics will be scaled down if the
              hardware page of a device  is smaller than the
              plotting page.
     = 'FULL' means that the  graphics will be scaled  up or
              down depending  upon the size  of the hardware
              page.
                                     Default: CMOD = 'DOWN'.

Notes:     -  The size of  a graphics screen will  be inter-
              preted as DIN A4 landscape. This means that by
              default graphics which are smaller than DIN A4
              will not fill the entire screen.
           -  SCLFAC and SCLMOD can affect each other.

GKSLIN and CGM files can be rotated by 90 degrees to use the
full  hardware page  of a device.  In general,  this is done
automatically by the driver program.

The call is:  CALL PAGMOD (CMOD)                     level 0

CMOD = 'LAND' means that the metafile is not rotated.
     = 'PORT' means that  the metafile is  rotated by 90 de-
              grees.
     = 'NONE' can be used to disable automatic plot file ro-
              tation in the driver program   (i.e. for Post-
              Script files).
                                     Default: CMOD = 'LAND'.

NEWPAG creates a new page.

The call is:  CALL NEWPAG                            level 1

Notes:     -  PostScript,  PDF  and CGM files can store mul-
              tiple pages.  For other output formats, NEWPAG
              is not useful.
           -  On X Window terminals, NEWPAG is waiting for a
              mouse button 2  event  before  displaying  the
              next page.  This mode can be changed  with the
              routine WINMOD. On other terminals, NEWPAG has
              the same effect as ERASE.                     

                         H W P A G E

files.

The call is:  CALL HWSCAL (XSCL)                     level 0

XSCL          is a floating point value used  for  the scale 
              operator.
                                                 Default: 1.

6.1.6 Error Handling

                         E R R M O D

The printing of warnings  and the  output of the protocol in 
DISFIN can be disabled with the routine ERRMOD.

The call is:  CALL ERRMOD (CKEY, CMOD)           level 1,2,3

CKEY          is a character string that can have the values
              'WARNINGS', 'CHECK', 'PROTOCOL' and 'ALL'.
              'WARNINGS' means the error messages  about bad
              parameters passed to DISLIN routines,  'CHECK'
              the out of range check  of coordinates  passed
              to plotting routines such as CURVE and 'PROTO-
              COL' the output of the protocol in DISFIN.
CMOD          is a character string that can have the values
              'ON' and 'OFF'.  For  CKEY = 'PROTOCOL',  CMOD
              can  have  the additional  value  'FILE'  that
              means  that  the protocol in  DISFIN  is  also
              written to the error file.
                                      Default: ('ALL', 'ON')

                         E R R F I L

By default, the name of the error file is 'dislin.err'.
An alternate filename can be set with ERRFIL.

              name.

                         E R R D E V

The routine  ERRDEV  defines the  output  device for  DISLIN
warnings. By default, warnings are written to the screen.

The call is:  CALL ERRDEV (COPT)                     level 0

COPT          is a character string that can have the values
              'CONS',  'FILE'  and 'APPEND'.  'APPEND' means
              that all  error messages  are appended  to the
              same file while for the keyword  'FILE'  a new
              error file is  created for each  DISINI/DISFIN
              cycle.
                                     Default: COPT = 'CONS'.

                         U N I T

UNIT defines the logical unit used for printing  error  mes-
sages and  listing data points  that lie outside of the axis
scaling.

The call is:  CALL UNIT (NU)                   level 1, 2, 3

NU            is the logical unit.  If NU = 0,  all messages
              will be suppressed.
                                             Default: NU = 6

Note:         UNIT  is an old DISLIN routine for suppressing 
              error messages.  It should be  replaced by the
              newer routines ERRMOD, ERRDEV and ERRFIL.

                         W I N A P P

The routine WINAPP defines if a  DISLIN program  should look
like a  Windows console, or more like a Windows program.  If
Windows mode is selected,  all  warnings  are  written to an
error file and the protocol in disfin is displayed in a wid-
get. 

The call is:  CALL WINAPP (COPT)                     level 0

COPT          is a character string that can have the values
              'CONSOLE' and 'WINDOWS'.
                                  Default: COPT = 'CONSOLE'.

6.1.7 Viewport Control

                         W I N D O W

This routine defines,  for  X Window terminals,  a region on
the screen where the graphics will be displayed. By default,

NX, NY        are the  screen  coordinates of the upper left
              corner.
NW, NH        are the  width  and  height  of the  window in
              screen coordinates.

Note:         In general,  the screen  size is   1280 * 1024
              pixels.

                         W I N S I Z

This routine defines the size of windows  and the resolution
of  DISLIN image formats such as  TIFF,  PNG,  BMP,  PPM and
IMAGE.  By default,  the window size is set to  2/3  of  the
screen size, and the resolution of  image  formats is  853 x
603 pixels. 

The call is:  CALL WINSIZ (NW, NH)          level 0, 1, 2, 3

  = 'NONE'    means  that  a colour table  with 256  colours
              will  be reduced to  129  colours  to conserve
              current screen and window colours.  The colour
              values will be reduced by the formula   (0 <=>
              0, i = (iclr + 1) / 2, iclr = 1, ... 255).
  = 'FULL'    means that all 256 colours will be displayed.
  = 'CONT'    means that  a colour table  with less than 129
              entries will be used.
                                     Default: CMOD = 'NONE'.

                        X 1 1 M O D

The routine  X11MOD  enables or disables backing store  for
graphic windows.

termination routine DISFIN.

The call is:  CALL WINMOD (CMOD)               level 1, 2, 3

CMOD  is a character string containing the mode.
  = 'FULL'    means that  DISFIN is waiting for a mouse but-
              ton 2 event.  After program continuation,  all
              windows are deleted.
  = 'NOHOLD'  means that  DISFIN is not waiting for a  mouse
              button 2 event.  After a call to  DISFIN,  all
              windows are deleted.

              FIN and windows are not deleted.
  = 'DELAY'   means that the program is blocked  for a short
              time in  DISFIN  before  it is  continued. The
              delay time  can be  defined  with  the routine
              WINOPT.
                                     Default: CMOD = 'FULL'.

                        W I N O P T

The routine WINOPT sets the delay time for the keyword  'DE-
LAY' in WINMOD.

The call is:  CALL WINOPT (IOPT, CKEY)         level 1, 2, 3

IOPT          is the delay time in seconds or milliseconds.
CKEY          is a character string that can have the values 
              'DELAY'  and  'MDELAY'.  For  CKEY = 'MDELAY',
              IOPT must contain milliseconds, otherwise sec-
              onds.
                                     Default: (10, 'DELAY').

                         W I N K E Y

The routine  WINKEY  enables a an additional key that can be
used for program continuation is DISFIN. Normally, the mouse
button 2 can be used for closing the graphics window. 

The call is:  CALL WINKEY (CKEY)               level 1, 2, 3

                         S E T X I D

The routine  SETXID  defines an external graphics window for
X11 and Windows displays.  All graphical output  is sent  to 
the external window.  For X11 displays,  an external  pixmap 
can also be defined.

The call is:  CALL SETXID (ID, CTYPE)       level 0, 1, 2, 3

ID            is the window or pixmap ID.
CTYPE         is a character string that can have the values
              'NONE',  'WINDOW', 'PIXMAP' and 'WIDGET'.  For 
              the keyword 'WIDGET', the ID of a  DISLIN draw
              widget can be used.
                                       Default: (0, 'NONE').

Notes:      - If an external  pixmap is used,  backing store 
              must also be enabled with the routine X11MOD.
            - An external window is not erased by DISINI. 
              This can be done with the routine ERASE.
            - External windows are not blocked in DISFIN 
              (see WINMOD).   
            - External windows can also be used for multiple 
              DISLIN windows  that are defined with the rou-
              tine OPNWIN.

6.1.8 Environment

A few routines in DISLIN  such as some font and map routines 
need the path to the DISLIN installation directory for read-
ing font and map files.  The  DISLIN  installation directory
can either be defined outside of a program with the environ-
ment variable DISLIN,  or within a program  with the routine
DISENV. If none of the methods above is applied, the default
directories c:\dislin and /usr/local/dislin are used on Win-
dows and Linux/UNIX systems.

                         D I S E N V

This routine sets the  DISLIN  environment within a program. 
If the DISLIN environment is already defined  outside of the
program, a call to DISENV has no affect.
        
The call is:  CALL DISENV (CPATH)           level 0, 1, 2, 3

CPATH         is a character string  that contains the  path
              to the DISLIN installation directory.
