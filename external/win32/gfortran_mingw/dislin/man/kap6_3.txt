The routine STMMOD modifies the behaviour of streamlines.

The call is:  CALL STMMOD (CMOD, CKEY)         level 1, 2, 3 

CMOD          is a character string that defines a mode.
CKEY          is a character string that can have the values 
              'INTEGRATION', 'ARROWS' and 'CLOSED'. The 
              keyword 'INTEGRATION'  defines the integration
              method used for streamlines. For this keyword,
              CMOD can have the values  'EULER',  'RK2'  and
              'RK4'. 'RK2' and 'RK4' mean  Runke-Kutta inte-
              gration of second and fourth order.
              For the keywords  'ARROWS' and 'CLOSED',  COPT
              can have the values  'ON' and 'OFF'.  'ARROWS'
              enables arrows at streamlines and the  keyword
              'CLOSED' means that  DISLIN  tries  to  detect 
              closed streamlines.  A good integration method
              such as 'RK4' should be used for this mode.  
                           Defaults: ('RK2', 'INTEGRATION'),
                       ('OFF', 'ARROWS'), ('OFF', 'CLOSED').

 = 'DISTANCE' sets the distance of  streamlines  for evenly-
              spaced streamlines. The distance is calculated
              as  X * (XPMAX - XPMIN).  The  distance  value 
              should be greater than the integration step.
                                          Default: X = 0.02.
 = 'ARROWS'   defines  the  space between  arrows plotted at

              to  the  starting point  is  closer  than this 
              value. The used distance is  X *  (XPMAX - XP-
              MIN).                      Default: X = 0.005.

              single  streamline is used to calculate multi-
              ple image  pixels.  The image  pixels  can  be 
              scaled  with  the vectors lengths  if the key-

              can be used where  XWIDTH has the same meaning
              as NWIDTH.
            - DISLIN tries to use hardware  features for the
              line width.  This  can  be  disabled  with the

              and outside edge of a path corner.
                                           Default: XFC = 2.

6.14 Base Transformations

The following  subroutines  create  a transformation  matrix
that  affects plot vectors  contained  within page  borders.
Vectors may be scaled, shifted and rotated and the transfor-
mations can be combined in any order.

                         T R F S H F

6.15 Shielded Regions

This section  describes how  to protect  regions  from being
overwritten.  Shielded regions can be defined  automatically
by  DISLIN  or explicitly by the user.  Shielded regions are
stored  in a  buffer  which can  then be manipulated  by the
user.

                         S H I E L D 

SHIELD  selects shielded regions which are set automatically
by DISLIN.

The call is:  CALL SHIELD (CAREA, CMODE)       level 1, 2, 3

CAREA         is a character string defining the regions:
  = 'MESSAG'  is used for text and numbers plotted by MESSAG
              and NUMBER.
  = 'SYMBOL'  will shield symbols.
  = 'BARS'    will shield bars plotted by BARS.
  = 'PIE'     will shield pie segments plotted by PIEGRF.
  = 'LEGEND'  will protect  legends.  All legend  attributes
              should be set before calling CURVE because the
              shielded region of a legend is defined by CUR-
              VE.  If there  is no legend  position  defined
              with  LEGPOS,  CURVE assumes  that the  legend
              lies  in the  upper right  corner  of the axis
              system.
CMODE         is a character string defining a status:
  = 'ON'      means that  the regions  defined above will be
              written  to the  shielding buffer and are pro-
              tected.
  = 'OFF'     means that regions will not be  written to the
              shielding  buffer.   Regions  that  are  still
              stored in the buffer will be shielded.
  = 'DELETE'  removes regions from the shielding buffer.
  = 'RESET'   is a  combination  of   'OFF'  and   'DELETE'.
              Regions are removed from and will not be writ-
              ten to the shielding buffer. To save computing
              time, this command should always be used  when
              shielding is no longer needed.
  = 'NOVIS'   The shielding of regions held in the shielding
              buffer is disabled. This is not valid for  re-
              gions newly written to the buffer.
  = 'VIS'     Disabled  regions will be  protected.  This is
              the default value for regions newly written to
              the buffer.

The following routines set user-defined regions:

The calls are: 

     CALL SHLREC  (NX, NY, NW, NH)          for rectangles
     CALL SHLRCT  (NX, NY, NW, NH, THETA)   for rotated 
                                            rectangles
     CALL SHLCIR  (NX, NY, NR)              for circles
     CALL SHLELL  (NX, NY, NA, NB, THETA)   for rotated
                                            ellipses
     CALL SHLPIE  (NX, NY, NR, ALPHA, BETA) for pie segments
     CALL SHLPOL  (NXRAY, NYRAY, N)         for polygons.

NX, NY       are  plot coordinates  of the upper left corner
             or the centre point.
NW, NH       are the width and height of rectangles.
NR, NA, NB   are radii in plot coordinates.
THETA        is a  rotation  angle  measured in degrees in a
             counter-clockwise direction.
ALPHA, BETA  are starting and ending angles for pie segments
             measured  in  degrees  in  a  counter-clockwise
             direction.
NXRAY, NYRAY are arrays  of the  dimension N containing  the
             corner points of a polygon.

The index of  shielded  regions  in the  buffer  can be  re-
quested with SHLIND. It returns the index of the region last
written to the buffer.

The call is:  CALL SHLIND (ID)                 level 1, 2, 3

ID            is the returned index.

                         S H L D E L 

SHLDEL removes entries from the shielding buffer.

The call is:  CALL SHLDEL (ID)                 level 1, 2, 3

ID            is the index of a shielded region. If ID is 0,
              all regions defined by the user  will be dele-
              ted.

                         S H L R E S 

SHLRES deletes regions last written to the shielding buffer.

The call is:  CALL SHLRES (N)                  level 1, 2, 3

N             is the number of regions to delete.

                         S H L V I S 

SHLVIS  disables or  enables shielded regions.  Disabled re-
gions  are no  longer protected  but are still  held  in the
shielding buffer.

The call is:  CALL SHLVIS (ID, CMODE)          level 1, 2, 3

ID            is the index of a shielded region. If ID is 0,
              all entries
              are disabled or enabled.
CMODE = 'ON'  enables shielded  regions. This is the default
              value for regions newly written to the buffer.
      = 'OFF' disables shielded regions.

Notes:     -  A frame  is plotted  around regions defined by
              the user.  The thickness  of frames can be set
              with FRAME.  Regions defined  automatically by
              DISLIN  are not enclosed by a frame but frames
              plotted  by  MESSAG  after  using  FRMESS  and
              shielded regions defined by MESSAG are identi-
              cal.
           -  Shielded regions can overlap each other. 
           -  The statement   CALL RESET  ('SHIELD')  resets
              shielding. All regions defined by  DISLIN  and
              the user are removed from the shielding buffer
              and no new regions will be written to the buf-
              fer.
           -  The number of shielded  regions is  limited to
              the size of the shielding buffer  which is set
              to  1000 words.  The number  of words  used by
              regions are: 
                  SHLREC = 6, SHLRCT = 7, SHLCIR = 5,
                  SHLELL = 7, SHLPIE = 7 and SHLPOL = 2*N+3.
           -  Shielding  of regions  is computer  intensive.
              Therefore, shielding should be used very care-
              fully  and shielded regions  should be deleted
              from the buffer when no longer needed.
           -  Base transformations  do not affect the  posi-
              tion of shielded regions.
           -  SHLPOL can be used between the routines GRFINI
              and GRFFIN.  The shielded  region will be pro-
              jected into  3-D space.  This is not valid for
              other shielded regions.
