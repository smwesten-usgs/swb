            Chapter 8: Elementary Plot Routines

This chapter  describes  elementary  subroutines  that  plot
lines,  vectors, circles,  ellipses,  pie segments and poly-
gons. There are versions for plot and user coordinates;  the
routines for user coordinates begin with  the keyword  'RL'.
These routines can only be called from level 2 or 3 after an
axis system has been defined.

8.1 Lines

XMOVE and  XDRAW are simple  subroutines for plotting lines.
They require absolute  page coordinates and are,  therefore,
not affected by a call to ORIGIN. Different line styles can-
not be used.  The routine  XMOVE  moves  the pen  to a point
while XDRAW draws a line to a point.

The calls are:  CALL XMOVE (X, Y)              level 1, 2, 3
                CALL XDRAW (X, Y)              level 1, 2, 3

X, Y            are absolute page coordinates.

The subroutines  STRTPT  and CONNPT require plot coordinates
as real numbers and allow different line styles to be used.

The calls are:  CALL STRTPT (X, Y)             level 1, 2, 3
                CALL CONNPT (X, Y)             level 1, 2, 3

X, Y            are real numbers containing the plot coordi-
                nates.

The corresponding routines for user coordinates are:

The calls are:  CALL RLSTRT (X, Y)                level 2, 3
                CALL RLCONN (X, Y)                level 2, 3

Note:           Lines plotted with  RLSTRT  and  RLCONN will
                not be cut off  at the  borders  of an  axis
                system. This can be enabled with the routine
                CLPBOR.  Points  lying  outside  of the axis
                scaling  will not be  listed by  RLSTRT  and
                RLCONN.

                          L I N E

LINE joins two points with a line. Different line styles can
be used.

The call is:  CALL LINE (NX, NY, NU, NV)       level 1, 2, 3

NX, NY        are the plot coordinates of the first point.
NU, NV        are the plot coordinates of the second point.

                         R L I N E

RLINE is the corresponding routine for user coordinates.

The call is:  CALL RLINE (X, Y, U, V)             level 2, 3

X, Y          are the user coordinates of the first point.
U, V          are the user coordinates of the second point.

Note:         RLINE  draws only that part  of the line lying
              inside the axis system. If NOCHEK is not used,
              points lying outside  the axis scaling will be
              listed.

8.2 Vectors

                         V E C T O R

VECTOR plots vectors with none, one or two arrow heads.

The call is:  CALL VECTOR (IX1, IY1, IX2, IY2, IVEC)
                                               level 1, 2, 3

IX1, IY1      are the plot coordinates of the start point.
IX2, IY2      are the plot coordinates of the end point.
IVEC          is an integer number  that defines the form of
              the arrow heads.  If IVEC = -1, the arrow head
              can be defined with the routine VECOPT. Other-
              wise,  IVEC can  contain  a four  digit number
              'wxyz'  specifying  the arrow  heads where the
              digits have the following meaning:

      w:      determines  the  ratio  of  width  and  length
              (0 - 9).
      x:      determines the size (0 - 9).
      y:      determines the form:
         = 0  filled
         = 1  not filled
         = 2  opened
         = 3  closed.
      z:      determines the position:
         = 0  no arrow heads are plotted
         = 1  at end points
         = 2  at start and end points
         = 3  at start and end points and in the same direc-
              tion.

scaling in the routines FIELD, VECFLD, FIELD3D and VECF3D.

The call is:  CALL VECCLR (ICLR)               level 1, 2, 3

ICLR          is a colour number.  If ICLR has the value -2, 
              colour scaling is enabled in vector fields.
              If ICLR = -1,  arrow heads  are plotted in the 
              foreground colour.  Otherwise, arrow heads are
              plotted in the colour ICLR.

                         V E C O P T

VECOPT  defines  some  vector options  such  as the  size of 
arrow heads and the appearance of  user-defined  arrows that
are enabled with  the vector number -1  in VECTOR and RLVEC.
The routine can also  disable  automatic scaling  of vectors
in vector fields.

The call is:  CALL VECOPT (XOPT, CKEY)         level 1, 2, 3

XOPT          contains a floating point option.
CKEY          is a character string that can have one of the
              following values:
 = 'ANGLE'    defines the angle in degrees that is used  for
              arrow heads plotted with the vector number -1.   
 = 'LENGTH'   defines the ratio of the arrow head and vector
              length for vectors plotted with the number -1.
 = 'SCALE'    sets a  scaling  factor  that is  used for the
              vector length in vector field routines such as
              VECFLD  and  VECMAT.  If XOPT = 0.,  automatic 
              scaling is enabled.
 = 'SIZE'     defines a scaling factor for the size of arrow
              heads.
                 Defaults: (20., 'ANGLE'), (0.25, 'LENGTH'),
                              (0., 'SCALE'),  (1.0, 'SIZE').

8.5 Geometric Figures

The following  subroutines  plot  geometric figures  such as
rectangles,  circles,  ellipses,  pie segments and polygons.

Notes:     -  Shading patterns  can be  defined with  SHDPAT
              and MYPAT. If the pattern number is zero,  the

              ARLN, the outline will be suppressed.
           -  The number of points in  AREAF and  RLAREA  is
              limited to 25000 for  Fortran 77.  There is no
              limitation for the  C and Fortran 90  versions
              of DISLIN. 
           -  For the  calculation  of the  radius in RLCIRC
              and RLPIE, the X-axis scaling is used.

              be altered with  CIRCSP (NSPC)  where  NSPC is
              the  arc length  in plot coordinates.  The de-
