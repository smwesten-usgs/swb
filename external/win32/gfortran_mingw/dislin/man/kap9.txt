              bit field.  The bits are numbered 0 - 15 where
              0 is the most significant bit.
NOUT          is a 16 bit variable  into which the bit field 
              is placed.        
IOUT          is the  bit  position  where  to  put  the bit
              field.
IOPT          controls whether the bits outside of the field 
              are set to zero or not.  If IOPT equal 0,  the
              bits are set to zero. If IOPT not equal 0, the
              bits are left as they are. For this case, NOUT
              is  also  used as  input  parameter.  In the C 
              function,  IOPT  is missing  in the  parameter 
              list and internally used with the value 1.

              are set to zero or not.  If IOPT equal 0,  the
              bits are set to zero. If IOPT not equal 0, the
              bits are left as they are. For this case, NOUT
              is  also  used as  input  parameter.  In the C 
              function,  IOPT  is missing  in the  parameter 
              list and internally used with the value 1.

9.7 Binary I/O  

This chapter describes  the utilities available to transform
Binary I/O from Fortran can cause some problems: unformatted
IO in Fortran  is  system-dependent  and direct  access  I/O
needs a fixed record length.  Therefore,  DISLIN offers some
C routines callable from Fortran.

                        O P E N F L

9.8 Window Terminals

9.8.1 Clearing the Screen

                        E R A S E

The routine  ERASE  clears the screen,  a graphics window or
the page of a raster format such as TIFF,  PNG, PPM and BMP.
In general,  this is done by  DISINI  at the beginning  of a
plot.

The call is:  CALL ERASE                       level 1, 2, 3

Note:         If backing store is enabled in DISLIN with the
              routine X11Mod,  the routine ERASE clears just
              the pixmap  and not directly the graphics win-
              dow.  Clearing just the pixmap  has the advan-
              tage  that a new plot  can be  created  on the
              pixmap  while the graphics window  remains un-
              changed.  The pixmap can then be copied to the
              graphics window with the routine SENDBF.  This
              double frame buffer effect avoids flickering.

9.8.2 Clearing the Output Buffer

                        S E N D B F

Normally, the graphical output to the screen is buffered. To
send  the buffer  to the screen,  the routine  SENDBF can be 
used.

The call is:  CALL SENDBF                      level 1, 2, 3

Note:         SENDBF  updates  also a  graphics window  with
              the current pixmap if backing store is enabled
              in the  routine  X11MOD.  SENDBF  can  be used
              after DISFIN if there is still a graphics win-
              dow  (i.e. after WINMOD ('NONE')).  

                        B U F M O D

The routine BUFMOD changes the behaviour of SENDBF.

              'SENDBF'. This keyword enables or disables the
              internal calls of  SENDBF  in  DISLIN routines 
              such as ENDGRF.
                                  Default: ('ON', 'SENDBF').

9.8.3 Multiple Windows

           -  A created window with OPNWIN is selected auto-
              matically for graphics output.
           -  External windows can also be used with  OPNWIN
              if the routine SETXID is called before.
           -  The routine  WINMOD  affects  the handling  of
              windows in the termination routine DISFIN.

9.8.4 Cursor Routines

The following routines  allow a user  to collect some X- and
Y-coordinates in a graphics window with the mouse. The coor-
dinates can be returned in pixels and in DISLIN plot coordi-
nates. All routines are also available in  DISLIN  draw wid-
gets.

                        C S R P O S

The routine  CSRPOS  sets the position  of the mouse pointer
and returns the position  if a character key or a mouse but-
ton is pressed. This routine can be used for cursor  naviga-
tion.

The call is:  CALL CSRPOS (NX, NY, IKEY)       level 1, 2, 3

NX, NY        are integer coordinates.  On entry,  the mouse 
              pointer is set to the position (NX, NY).  If a
              character key is pressed,  the position of the
              mouse is returned in NX and NY.
IKEY          is the  returned  ASCII  code for  the pressed 
              key. The  cursor  keys can also be used  where
              the following  values are returned: 1 for cur-
              sor left, 2 for cursor up, 3 for cursor right, 
              4 for cursor down.  The value 5 is returned if
              the  left  mouse button  is clicked,  and  the 
              value 6 for the right mouse button.

9.9 Elementary Image Routines

The following routines allow transferring of image data bet-
ween windows, files and arrays. The output format must be an
image format such as CONS, TIFF,  PNG, BMP and PPM,  but the
writing of image data to  PostScript  and  PDF files is also
supported.  If the output format  is PostScript  or PDF, the 
size of images  and the  position  of an image on the output
page can be defined with the routines IMGSIZ and IMGBOX.

9.10 Transparency

The following routines allow transparency effects in DISLIN
by using alpha blending. Alpha blending is only possible if
the output format is a raster format  such as screen output
or plotting to an image file like PNG and TIFF.
A second restriction is that the output device must support
the full range of RGB colours.  This means that you have to
enable the option IMGFMT ('RGB') for image files.
    
                        T P R I N I

The routine TPRINI initializes  transparency. All following

frame buffer  is mixed with the real frame buffer  by using
alpha blending.

The call is:  CALL TPRFIN                     level 1, 2, 3

                        T P R V A L

The call is:  CALL TPRVAL (X)                 level 1, 2, 3

X             is a  floating point value  in the range from 
              0.0 to 1.0,  where 0.0 means a fully transpar-
              ent colour  and 1.0 means  a fully opaque col-
              our. 
                                                Default: 1.0

The following program code plots three circles with alpha 
blending:

      CALL TPRVAL(0.5)
      CALL COLOR('RED')
      CALL TPRINI 
      CALL CIRCLE(500,500,500)
      CALL TPRFIN

      CALL COLOR('GREEN')
      CALL TPRINI 
      CALL CIRCLE(750,750,500)

CMOD          is a character string defining an option.
CKEY          is a character string  that can have the val-
              ues 'BACK' and 'FIGURE'.  For CKEY =  'BACK',
              the  parameter  CMOD  can have the values 'O- 
              PAQUE' and 'NOOPAQUE'.  'OPAQUE' means that a
              transparent figure maybe mixed with the back-
              ground  colour  black  or  white.  'NOOPAQUE'
              means that the background  colour is  defined
              as fully transparent.  The elementary figures
              in  DISLIN  such as  circles,  rectangles and 
              polygons contain already a  TPRINI/TPRFIN en-
              vironment  that can be enabled  with the  key
              'FIGURES' and the mode  'AUTO'.
                               Default: ('OPAQUE', 'BACK'),
                                     ('NOAUTO', 'FIGURES').

The example above can also be written as:

      CALL TPRVAL(0.5)
      CALL TPRMOD('AUTO','FIGURES')
      CALL COLOR('RED')
      CALL CIRCLE(500,500,500)

      CALL COLOR('GREEN')
      CALL CIRCLE(750,750,500)

      CALL COLOR('BLUE')
      CALL CIRCLE(1000,500,500)
